==================================
Welcome to the Open Ephys project!
==================================

This GUI was designed to provide a fast and flexible interface for acquiring and visualizing data from extracellular electrodes.


This version of the GUI is not in active development any more 
=============

We switched to a true plugin architecture in which individual processors are compiled independently.
The new version is found here: https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI

If you are working on code using the non-plugin version, please see https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OEW/Plugin+architecture for how to adapt your code to the plugin architecture.
